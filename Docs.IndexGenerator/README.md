# Docs Index Generator

This project is not part of the NanoXLSX library itself but serves as a tool to generate documentation indexes for the NanoXLSX project.

The index generator creates an index page for the particular documentation pages, generated by Doxygen.

## Usage

When the solution is built, several configuration files are written by NanoXLSX projects. These configuration files are automatically picked up by the generator and used to replace values, like the library name or version.
After the solution build is finished, the index page with all necessary files (e.g. CSS or icons) is available and can be committed.
Once committed and pushed, a GutHub Action will use these files to create de documentation pages (gh-pages).

## What to maintain?

Some configuration files (in folder **Config**) must be maintained manually:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| root-config.json | Main configuration file for the index generator |
| plugin-config.json | Configuration file for all available sub-pages, generated by specific Doxygen instances |
